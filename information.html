            <h2>The AI model :</h2>
            <p>I created an ia model from scratch in Python. With only libraries like <a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a> or <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">maptplotlib</a>. In the absence of a learning library, all calculations have to be redone. I trained my model on this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data">MNIST dataset</a>, giving it 40,000 28-by-28-pixel photos of handwritten digits. On the train set, my model achieves an accuracy of around 85%. (With a possible risk of overfitting).</p>

            <h2>AI integration :</h2>
            <p>Using the javascript programming language, I created a canvas that can be drawn, then at the end of a plot javascript will resize the canvas in the background to a size of 28 by 28 pixels. Then, using the <a href="https://mathjs.org/">mathjs</a> library, I give the canvas image to my model, which then gives me the number with the highest probability.</p>

            <h2>AI error field:</h2>
            <p>Training ia is not perfect without the use of training libraries or just by overfitting, but also the fact that the canva is resized increases the potential for error.</p>
